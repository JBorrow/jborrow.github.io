<p>Daily use of the following programming languages, with my experience outlined
in parentheses:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>python</code> (7 years)</li>
<li><code>C</code> with <code>MPI</code> (3 year)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am familiar and can work with with the following languages:</p>

workflow, along with contributing to many open source projects, mainly in
<code>python</code>, myself. I also have a history of advocating for improved software
design and quality in science.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, I have daily experience working on large (4000+ core,
Tier-2 and Tier-1) HPC systems and codes, as well as benchmarking those codes
on various architechtures.</p>

<h4 id="technical-writing">Technical Writing</h4>

<p>I am an experienced technical writer, having now completed my masters and
currently working on my PhD. Please find a selection of my articles in
<a href="../publications">Publications</a> and my blog posts meant for a slightly more
general audience in <a href="../blog">Blog</a>.</p>

<h4 id="public-speaking">Public Speaking</h4>

<p>As a PhD student, I give talks both to the public and to academic audiences
regularly. Over the course of the past three years, I have developed my
public speaking skills to the point where I am now a confident, consice, and
competent speaker. The skills that I developed whilst working as a designer
during the summer as an undergraduate also allow me to make impressive
slideshow presentations, and I have designed the template that all members
of the SWIFT team use. Please find a list of my talks in <a href="../publications">Publications</a>.</p>

<h3 id="research-experience">Research Experience</h3>

<p>Please find below extra research experience I have gained aside from my PhD
and masters.</p>

<h4 id="kavli-summer-program-summer-2018">Kavli Summer Program: Summer 2018</h4>

<p>Selected for a highly competitive, expenses paid, summer program at the Center
for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in New York. This very
intense <a href="https://kspa.soe.ucsc.edu/2018">6-week program</a> brought together
faculty, postdocs, and students from all around the world to work on something
new.</p>

<p>I worked with Daniel Angles-Alcazar and Romeel Dave on a project exploring
inter-Lagrangian transfer of gas between galaxies. During the program I
developed the open-source python package
<a href="https://github.com/jborrow/lagrangian-transfer"><code>LTCaesar</code></a>.</p>

<p>This program gave me valuable experience in working to tight deadlines, working
with simulation data, and gave me a valuable opportunity to work wtih an
all-new supervision team. The collaboration that we started at the summer
program continues today and we hope that it will result in a number of
publications over the coming years.</p>

<h4 id="leaps-summer-school-summer-2015">LEAPS Summer School: Summer 2015</h4>

<p>As an undergraduate, I was one of the youngest students selected for the
competitive, fully funded, LEAPS program in Leiden.</p>

<p>During this program I stepped out of my comfort zone significantly, working
with Pedro Russo on a system for public engagement evaluation and appraisal.
This resulted in a talk at the 2AM: Amsterdam conference, as a 2nd year
undergraduate.</p>

<p>The LEAPS program broadened by horizons significantly, and I gained skills
working in small teams, developed my technical writing appreciably, and
began seriously working on public engagement projects in Durham.</p>

<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>

<h4 id="level-4-python-support-2019-2020">Level 4 Python Support: 2019-2020</h4>

<p>I managed a small student community, similar to Stack Overflow, for
computing help regarding Level 4 (Masters) projects at Durham. This
involved moderating content, and mainly helping students in a one-on-one
fashion with their specific coding issues in python and other languages.</p>

<h4 id="level-2-computational-physics-2018-2019">Level 2 Computational Physics: 2018-2019</h4>

<p>I taught workshops on python coding, alongside the implementation of
various numerical techniques.</p>

<h4 id="foundations-of-physics-3a-2017-2018">Foundations of Physics 3A: 2017-2018</h4>

<p>I taught workshops (similar to problems classes) for the 3rd year Physics
module Foundations of Physics 3A. This module encompasses quantum mechanics,
nuclear physics, and particle physics.</p>

<h3 id="public-engagement">Public Engagement</h3>

<p>Since even before the LEAPS program described above, I have been active in
engaging the public. Please find below a selection of events and projects that
I have not only been involved in but lead.</p>

<h4 id="school-visit-spring-2018-2020">School Visit: Spring 2018-2020</h4>

<p>Organised a visit to the department, and tour of the supercomputing center,
for a local Year-2 class. This involved recruiting speakers and helpers,
coopoerating with teachers at the school, and leading the visit on the day.</p>

<p>This was a highly successful visit that has repeated three times, and was
enjoyed by both the students and staff.</p>

<h4 id="pint-of-science-durham-city-2017-2018">Pint of Science Durham City: 2017 &amp; 2018</h4>

<p>In 2017, I was the publicity manager for the <a href="https://www.pintofscience.co.uk">Pint of
Science</a> festival in Durham City. This
involved leading a small team, producing publicity materials, and social media
marketing. The events were highly successful with many selling out.</p>

<p>In 2018, I was be the City Manager for Durham, and lead the project
management of the large team of volunteers that run Pint of Science alongside
Lara Small.</p>

<h4 id="galaxy-makers-continued-since-summer-2016">Galaxy Makers: Continued since Summer 2016</h4>

<p>Galaxy Makers was a highly successful exhibition at the Royal Society Summer
Science Festival in 2018. Since then, we have displayed the exhibition numerous
times.</p>

<p>For Galaxy Makers, I developed a highly popular online component in
<a href="https://www.galaxymakers.org">galaxymakers.org</a> that allows participants to
re-play the exhibition online. This online component was so novel it warranted
talks at international conferences and publication in the Communicating
Astronomy with the Public journal.</p>

<h4 id="cafe-scientifique-durham-2014-2017">Cafe Scientifique Durham: 2014-2017</h4>

<p>For three years during my undergraduate degree I ran Cafe Scientifique Durham
City. This invovled recruiting speakers for each week during term time, working
with local venues, and producing and spreading marketing material.</p>

<p>Overall, I organised over 50 talks, attended by many thousands of participants.</p>

<h4 id="other">Other</h4>

<p>In addition to the above, I am regularly involved in giving tours of the
department to prospective students and alumni, presenting the outreach
materials we have at science festivals, and appearing at conferences to
(such as EWASS2018) to present our novel public engagement methodologies.</p>
