  <h1>What your advisor probably doesn&#39;t know about python that you should</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Sun, Sep 23, 2018</span>
  <p>&lsquo;Tis the season for new PhD students to join the ranks. If you are going into
any field of Physics (or any other science for that matter), there&rsquo;s a good
chance that you&rsquo;re going to get told to use python for pretty much everything
going forward. Reading data, running analysis, making figures&hellip;  Welcome to
your new life. Going forward, I&rsquo;m going to assume you are at least somewhat
familiar with the python programming language. If you&rsquo;re not, I suggest
checking out one of the great online courses that <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/">MIT
offers</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several major problems with the, now prolific, use of programming in
science. Firstly, there are few opportunities for mentoring and code review -
this is something you&rsquo;re going to mainly have to figure out on your own.
Secondly, bad practices are <em>everywhere</em>. The first one to get out of the way
is that <em>there is no reason whatsoever that you, as a science graduate student,
should be using python2</em>. If your advisor has some old code that they insist
you use, you can probably just use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html">2to3</a> to upgrade it. If you really
need a list of reasons that python3 is better than python2 (other than the
fact that support for python2 is rapidly faltering), check out this <a href="https://github.com/arogozhnikov/python3_with_pleasure">great
GitHub repository</a>
(my favourite new feature is <a href="https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/">f strings</a>).
Another consequence of these bad practices, among other things, is that people
rarely learn how to &lsquo;properly&rsquo; write python code. There are many definitions
of the word &lsquo;properly&rsquo; in this context, but here I&rsquo;ll use it to mean extensible,
readable, and clean code.</p>
<p>Hopefully the tips and ideas below can help you figure things out as a new
graduate student and find your way in the python world.</p>
