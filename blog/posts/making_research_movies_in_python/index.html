  <h1>Making Research Movies in python</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 6, 2018</span>
  

<p>Sometimes, you need more than a picture to say 1000 words. A few hundred pictures, all
stuck together in a movie, might give you all of the information that you need,
though. However, making movies in everyone&rsquo;s favourite language (clearly <code>python</code>) is
quite obtuse, at least when you try to use the de-facto plotting library
<a href="https://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of ways that you can go about making a little movie of your results.
An example of such a movie is shown below, which shows a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
(a density slice) evolving through time. This was made using <code>FuncAnimation</code> in
matplotlib, which we&rsquo;ll discuss later.</p>

<div class="video-container" style="width:100%">
<video src="https://gitlab.cosma.dur.ac.uk/swift/swiftsim/uploads/bcfd3c908cd88cbab854c82e5f2fd7a6/khmovie_pressure-energy.mp4" width="100%" controls="true" data-setup="{}" data-title="khmovie_pressure-energy"></video>
</div>

<h2 id="the-simple-method-generating-individual-frames">The simple method: generating individual frames</h2>

<p>The most simple way to make a movie is to take your regular plot-generating script
and run it <em>n</em> times to get <em>n</em> frames using slightly different data each time. That
will write <em>n</em> <code>.png</code> images, which you can then stitch together using a utility
like <code>ffmpeg</code>.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s look at a sine wave:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys

# Grab the frame number from python3 easy_mode.py &lt;x&gt;
frame_number = int(sys.argv[1])

# Some global variables to define the whole run
total_number_of_frames = 100
total_width_of_sine_wave = 2 * np.pi

# How far through are we?
current_factor = frame_number / total_number_of_frames

current_x_data = np.linspace(
    0,
    total_width_of_sine_wave * current_factor,
    frame_number
)
current_y_data = np.sin(current_x_data)

# Now we can do the plotting!
plt.plot(current_x_data, current_y_data)

# Have to set these otherwise we will get one ugly plot!
plt.xlim(0, total_width_of_sine_wave)
plt.ylim(-1.2, 1.2)

plt.xlabel(&quot;$x$&quot;)
plt.ylabel(&quot;$\sin(x)$&quot;)

# Make me pretty
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(&quot;image_{:03d}.png&quot;.format(frame_number))
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we can make all 100 frames by running a little bash for loop,</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">for image in {0..100}
do
  python3 easy_mode.py $image
done
</code></pre>

<p>and stitch them together in a movie using a (somewhat complicated) <code>ffmpeg</code> command,</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">ffmpeg -i image_%03d.png -c:v libx264 -vf fps=25 -pix_fmt yuv420p out_easy_mode.mp4
</code></pre>

<div class="video-container" style="width:100%">
<video src="../making_research_movies_in_python/out_easy_mode.mp4" width="100%" controls="true" data-setup="{}" data-title="out_easy_mode"></video>
</div>

<p>This ends up looking fine, but takes <em>ages</em>. There are a number of reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are re-launching python for every frame, which takes quite a while in itself,</li>
<li>We are re-importing all of the libraries we need every time, as well as generating
their internal data structures (such as the matplotlib axis),</li>
<li>We are re-generating data for every single frame, rather than re-using in-memory data.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very convenient way of making a movie, especially if you already have a
script. But when it is easy to make the data ahead of time, and all you want to do is
plot a sub-set of them, then it is a huge waste of resources. This is especially
prominent in science, where even <em>loading</em> the data may take a significant amount of
time. To make this video, including the <code>ffmpeg</code> stitching, it took 74 seconds on my
base-model 2017 MacBook Pro.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-dreaded-funcanimation">Using the dreaded <code>FuncAnimation</code></h2>

<p>We can simplify the above massively, at least for this simple case, by using the
built-in <code>matplotlib.animation</code> API. We&rsquo;ll no longer need to do that bash for loop,
and the script itself will not have to re-generate all of the data!</p>

<p>There are two ways that you can access animations in <code>matplotlib</code>. The first is through
<code>FuncAnimation</code>, where you supply a function that updates a given <code>axes</code> object to
generate each frame, and <code>ArtistAnimation</code>, which takes a list of <code>matplotlib</code> <code>artist</code>
objects.</p>

<p>For the sine wave example above, it should be fairly simple to figure out how to write
a function that selects a sub-set of the data for plotting at a given frame <em>n</em>. The
code that does this below is fairly simple. All we need to do is define a function,
called in this case <code>animate</code>, which updates the line plot that we have for each frame.
We can pre-generate the data and just select sub-sets of it in this case.</p>

<p>The hard part in this case is finding out <em>how</em> to update the line object. Each type
of <code>matplotlib</code> object behaves in a slightly different way, but they usually have a
<code>set_&lt;something&gt;</code> method that you can use to do this kind of updating.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation

# Some global variables to define the whole run
total_number_of_frames = 100
total_width_of_sine_wave = 2 * np.pi
all_x_data = np.linspace(0, total_width_of_sine_wave, total_number_of_frames)
all_y_data = np.sin(all_x_data)


def animate(frame, line):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Animation function. Takes the current frame number (to select the potion of
    data to plot) and a line object to update.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # Not strictly neccessary, just so we know we are stealing these from
    # the global scope
    global all_x_data, all_y_data

    # We want up-to and _including_ the frame'th element
    current_x_data = all_x_data[: frame + 1]
    current_y_data = all_y_data[: frame + 1]

    line.set_xdata(current_x_data)
    line.set_ydata(current_y_data)

    # This comma is necessary!
    return (line,)


# Now we can do the plotting!
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
# Initialise our line
line, = ax.plot([0], [0])

# Have to set these otherwise we will get one ugly plot!
ax.set_xlim(0, total_width_of_sine_wave)
ax.set_ylim(-1.2, 1.2)

ax.set_xlabel(&quot;$x$&quot;)
ax.set_ylabel(&quot;$\sin(x)$&quot;)

# Make me pretty
fig.tight_layout()

animation = FuncAnimation(
    # Your Matplotlib Figure object
    fig,
    # The function that does the updating of the Figure
    animate,
    # Frame information (here just frame number)
    np.arange(total_number_of_frames),
    # Extra arguments to the animate function
    fargs=[line],
    # Frame-time in ms; i.e. for a given frame-rate x, 1000/x
    interval=1000 / 25
)
animation.save(&quot;out_funcanimation.mp4&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Thankfully, it looks exactly the same!</p>

<div class="video-container" style="width:100%">
<video src="../making_research_movies_in_python/out_funcanimation.mp4" width="100%" controls="true" data-setup="{}" data-title="out_funcanimation"></video>
</div>

<p>To make this movie using the <code>FuncAnimation</code> method, it took 2.16 seconds on my base-
model 2017 (13 inch) MacBook Pro. That&rsquo;s a speed-up of around 30x just by not launching
the python interpreter each time! We also didn&rsquo;t need any kind of clumsy bash for-loop
to make the frames, and didn&rsquo;t need to hand-call <code>ffmpeg</code>, that was all handled for
us.</p>

<h2 id="2d-grid-movie">2D Grid Movie</h2>

<p>A very common use of a movie is to show the time-evolution of a visualistion - like the
movie of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that I showed earlier. This is a little more
difficult than it might first seem, because of the way that the resulting object from
<code>imshow</code> or <code>pcolormesh</code> behaves. Unfortunately, those both return different things,
so we&rsquo;ll focus on <code>imshow</code> in this specific example as it seems the most popular.</p>

<p>The set-up is very similar. Just write an <code>animate</code> function that loads (or finds in
memory) the correct data, and have it play with a <code>set_&lt;x&gt;</code> method. You will also want
to do some playing around with the figure properties to make sure that you are only
plotting on the right pixels. To do that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the <code>figsize</code> parameter to <code>(1, 1)</code></li>
<li>You can then set the number of pixels in your output video by setting the <code>dpi</code>
parameter in the <code>save</code> method on your <code>FuncAnimation</code> object</li>
<li>Set this to the same number of pixels as in your data (to avoid smoothing)</li>
<li>Use <code>adjust_subplots</code> on your figure to remove any bounding whitespace</li>
<li>Finally, use <code>.axis(&quot;off&quot;)</code> on your axis object to remove the thin black line
that normally bounds the plot</li>
</ul>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to manually set <code>vmin</code> and <code>vmax</code> on your colour map, or map your data
yourself. Otherwise, those will be set based on the <em>initial</em> frame and may get
completely washed out.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a script that does that with some random data:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation

# Some global variables to define the whole run
total_number_of_frames = 100
all_data = [
    np.random.rand(512, 512) for x in range(100)
]


def animate(frame):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Animation function. Takes the current frame number (to select the potion of
    data to plot) and a line object to update.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # Not strictly neccessary, just so we know we are stealing these from
    # the global scope
    global all_data, image

    # We want up-to and _including_ the frame'th element
    image.set_array(all_data[frame])

    return image


# Now we can do the plotting!
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(1, 1))
# Remove a bunch of stuff to make sure we only 'see' the actual imshow
# Stretch to fit the whole plane
fig.subplots_adjust(0, 0, 1, 1)
# Remove bounding line
ax.axis(&quot;off&quot;)

# Initialise our plot. Make sure you set vmin and vmax!
image = ax.imshow(all_data[0], vmin=0, vmax=1)

animation = FuncAnimation(
    # Your Matplotlib Figure object
    fig,
    # The function that does the updating of the Figure
    animate,
    # Frame information (here just frame number)
    np.arange(total_number_of_frames),
    # Extra arguments to the animate function
    fargs=[],
    # Frame-time in ms; i.e. for a given frame-rate x, 1000/x
    interval=1000 / 25
)

# Try to set the DPI to the actual number of pixels you're plotting
animation.save(&quot;out_2dgrid.mp4&quot;, dpi=512)
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the movie that produces!
<div class="video-container" style="width:100%">

</div></p>

<h1 id="sticking-it-all-together-with-ffmpeg">Sticking it all together (with <code>ffmpeg</code>)</h1>

<p>Sometimes you have more than one movie that you would like to show side-by-side. There
are a bunch of ways you can do this (even by just using two <code>image</code> objects in a
<code>FuncAnimation</code>), but it&rsquo;s often nice to do things outside of python, as you may
want to make different combinations. I would recommend making a single &ldquo;movie&rdquo; with
each python script, and then using the following ffmpeg filter to stick them
together.</p>

<p>Say you have two videos, one called <code>x.mp4</code>, and the other called <code>y.mp4</code>. You want to
display them side-by-side. <code>ffmpeg</code> makes this very easy through it&rsquo;s complex filter
function, so all you have to do is write</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i x.mp4 -i y.mp4 -filter_complex hstack out.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>That was easy! Things get a little more complicated when you want more videos in your
layout, though. Then you&rsquo;ll have to learn a little bit of <code>ffmpeg</code> magic.</p>

<p>In this case, we have four videos <code>a.mp4</code>, <code>b.mp4</code>, <code>c.mp4</code>, and <code>d.mp4</code>. We want to
stack them in a 2x2 grid. To do this, we have two options. We could run <code>ffmpeg</code> three
times - twice with <code>hstack</code> to put two of them together, and once with <code>vstack</code> to
stack those 2x1&rsquo;s on top of each other. Alternatively, we can use variables within
<code>ffmpeg</code> itself. Here&rsquo;s the command to do that - we&rsquo;ll break this down afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i a.mp4 -i b.mp4 -i c.mp4 -i d.mp4 -filter_complex &quot;[0:v][1:v]hstack[top];[2:v][3:v]hstack[bottom];[top][bottom]vstack[out]&quot; -map &quot;[out]&quot; out.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few things here that aren&rsquo;t immediately obvious:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[i:v]</code> references the <code>-i &lt;video&gt;</code> input that was given (in that order, such that here <code>[0:v]</code> corresponds to <code>a.mp4</code>, <code>[2:v]</code> corresponds to <code>c.mp4</code> as a kind of variable</li>
<li>To apply a filter, it requires the input &lsquo;variables&rsquo; on the left, and the output
variables on the right, <code>[&lt;input 1&gt;][&lt;input 2&gt;]&lt;filter&gt;[&lt;output&gt;]</code></li>
<li>The semicolon in the <code>filter_complex</code> string separates individual filters</li>
<li>We need to map <code>[out]</code> to the global scope to let <code>ffmpeg</code> know that&rsquo;s the variable
we want to write to file</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what that looks like when we stick four movies with different colourmaps
together (bonus points for those who know the names of all of these, and which one
you should <em>never</em> use):</p>

<div class="video-container" style="width:100%">
<video src="../making_research_movies_in_python/out_compare_all.mp4" width="100%" controls="true" data-setup="{}" data-title="out_compare_all"></video>
</div>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<ul>
<li>You can stick together a bunch of frames generated from a script with <code>ffmpeg</code>, but
it&rsquo;s super slow!</li>
<li><code>matplotlib</code>&rsquo;s <code>FuncAnimation</code> is a bit weird, but ultimately very helpful</li>
<li><code>ffmpeg</code> can stick your movies together for you, allowing you to not have to
worry about re-generating frames quite as often</li>
</ul>

<p>And with that, I&rsquo;ll let you go forth and make some fantastic movies!</p>
