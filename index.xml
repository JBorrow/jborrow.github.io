      <description>Sometimes, you need more than a picture to say 1000 words. A few hundred pictures, all stuck together in a movie, might give you all of the information that you need, though. However, making movies in everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite language (clearly python) is quite obtuse, at least when you try to use the de-facto plotting library matplotlib.
There are a bunch of ways that you can go about making a little movie of your results.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Algorithms in a Different Context: Smooth Fields From Particles</title>

      <description>I recently gave a talk about some new hydrodynamics schemes that we&amp;rsquo;re implementing in SWIFT, our cosmological simulation code. A hydrodynamics scheme takes a density field (or something similar) as an input, and then tells you how to move the elements due to the fluid forces that each element experiences. These schemes are all Lagrangian - they use particles - rather than the more traditional Eulerian grid schemes. This is handy, as a Lagrangian scheme gives you a bunch of conservation properties for free, and with particles you can automatically sample denser regions with more elements rather than having to &amp;ldquo;refine&amp;rdquo; your grid.</description>

      <description>Pint of Science 2018 came to Durham on the 14th of May, and was a three-day long festival of science. For the Durham &amp;ldquo;chapter&amp;rdquo;, I ran publicity &amp;ndash; that involved making posters and flyers, contacting media outlets, and doing &amp;ldquo;social media&amp;rdquo;. It also involved managing a small team of people to help me out with all of that.
Pint of Science ended up being a fantastic event. For most of it, I presented our Galaxy Makers &amp;ldquo;Tour the Universe&amp;rdquo; virtual reality demo at our Atoms to Galaxies event.</description>

      <description>See below for a few highlights from my recent work. I regularly post things to my twitter profile (@JBorrow) if you want an even more up-to-date list! This page usually contains interesting visualisations and tid-bits; for an overview of my published research work please see publications.
THESAN-HR Flagship This image shows a zoom in on a very early dwarf galaxy (at z=7) in the flagship THESAN-HR simulations. In this volume, we zoom in on the hot gas halo to show the complex gas structure, followed by zooming into the 1 kpc, dust, gas disk.</description>
